# Volaser PCB

The Volaser PCB connects the Sparkfun ESP32 microcontroller board which the servo motor controller and two lasers. It also hosts a 5V voltage regulator for the laser modules and a 3.3V regulator for the microcontroller and stepper motor driver. To make your own, send the gerber files to any PCB fabrication facility (an easy one to use is https://jlcpcb.com/).
